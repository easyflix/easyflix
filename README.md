## Install

### Requirements
1. [Create an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) on The Movie Database and [request an API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
2. Install Java on your computer/server (minimum JRE version 8)
3. Download [the latest Easyflix release](https://github.com/easyflix/easyflix/releases) and extract the archive

### Configure and run

#### Method 1: The configuration file
1. Create a file named `easyflix.conf` in your easyflix folder
2. Edit it with this minimal configuration:
```
tmdbApiKey: "<your-TMDb-api-key>"
auth.key: "<any-secret-key>"
auth.password: "<a-password>"
```
Notes:
  * Check what configuration keys you can override by consulting [easyflix-reference.conf](https://github.com/easyflix/easyflix/blob/master/src/main/resources/easyflix-reference.conf)
  * `auth.key` can be anything but should preferably be a 128 bits hexadecimal key for security
  * `auth.password` is the password you will use to log into your Easyflix instance
3. Run `bin\easyflix` and then type `start` or run `bin\easyflix start` directly

#### Method 2: Configure by command-line arguments
Run `bin\easyflix start --help` to see what arguments are available.

## FAQ

* Can Easyflix play any video?

Easyflix provides an HTML5 player which means that you can only play videos in a format supported by your browser. The formats that are supported by modern browsers change over time. You can get an idea of your browser support for videos by referring to [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=video). The most commonly supported format at the time of writing is the [MPEG-4/H.264 video format](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mpeg4).

* Where does Easyflix find metadata for my movies and TV Shows?

Easyflix is powered by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and uses [its API](https://developers.themoviedb.org) to fetch presentation metadata for your videos. As such you will need [an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) and a [valid API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) from The Movie Database to run Easyflix.
